# Anarchy quiz (name in progress)

## how to use (because you arent just given a remote and know how to use it perfectly)

users can create a quiz with the bot and users can answer solve quizes from other users.

to create a quiz a moderator needs to use "create Quizpost" on the mod menu to the right of the subreddit.

then on any quizpost use "Create my own Quiz" and hit "Create new Question" directly after it.
then fill in the form.

questions get appended at the end of your quiz. questions cannot be edited, only deleted, so keep that in mind.
once your quiz is posted it cannot be edited further.

use the arrow buttons to swap between questions and the green "create" button to create the quiz.

quizes can only have up to 20 questions or your level, whichever is lower.

to make moderating easier there will be a pinned comment for every quiz that has the questions in spoilers.
the corect answer isnt there but the answers are.
